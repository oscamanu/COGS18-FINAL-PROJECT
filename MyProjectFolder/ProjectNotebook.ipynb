    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique. It involves shifting the characters of a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my implementation, we also shift digits!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project implements the basic Caesar Cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is working with Python code and geting comfortable executing code with minimal assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute the `my_script.py` file.\n",
    "2. Input personal information as prompted.\n",
    "3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt a text (OR Brute Force Decrypt).\n",
    "4. View the encrypted/decrypted result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage\n",

    "###### For extra credit, if you go above and beyond on the minimal project requirements and challenge yourself to approach a project that is more complex than the basic requirements, requires you to learn something beyond what was taught in the course, or uses code concepts not taught in class, explain this at the end of your Jupyter notebook. Here, you should explain why your approach was particularly difficult/challenging for you and how your work goes beyond the minimal project requirements.\n",

    "If I had more time on this project, I would implement other ciphers and other encrytion methods alongside the Caesar Cipher, since the Caesar Cipher is fairly simple. I implemented a \"Brute Force\" algorithm which shows the simplicity of the Caesar Cipher because of how easy it was broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that I was trying to work on and complete was another method to break the Caesar Cipher called Frequency analysis, which uses the frequency of commonly used letter in the enlgish alphabet to determine which of the 26 options that my Brute Force algorithm gave us would be most probable in being the correct one. This was fairly complex to understand, so if I had a little more time I would try to understand this one a bit more"
